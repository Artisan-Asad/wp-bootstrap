Wordpress Bootstrap 3 Starter Theme

A Wordpress theme built from scratch with Bootstrap 3. It's a starting point for any Wordpress / Bootstrap 3 development efforts, not a finished product. I've solved the nasty navigation issues that you'll run into if starting from scratch, and build a custom frontpage, if you care to use it. This theme is based on one of the Bootstrap examples.

Let me know if you have any issues with it, and feel free to send pull requests!
